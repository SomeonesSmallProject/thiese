This is a small project about someone graduating.

In the `train` folder, contains all code about the model.

In else folder, contains all code about the website.

We should know that the model is not perfect, but it is a good start. And the weight file of the model is too large to upload to github, so maybe you would like to train it by yourself.

The website depended on .Net 8.0 and python >=3.10, so you should install it first, or using vs2022 to open the project.

There is a json file in the `wwwroot` folder, which contain all needed configuration of the website. You can change it to fit your need.

I hope you will have a nice day, and God bless you and me. Thanks for reading.
